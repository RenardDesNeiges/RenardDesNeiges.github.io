### [CS-456 : Artificial Neural Networks / Reinforcement Learning](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/artificial-neural-networks-reinforcement-learning-CS-456) 
CS-456 is the master-level reinforcement learning course at EPFL and is taught by Prof. [Wulfram Gerstner](https://people.epfl.ch/111732?lang=en). The course mostly focuses on reinforcement learning (both in tabular case and in the deep-rl setting). I have contributed to the course as a TA helping students during exercise sessions for two years. The second year during which I worked as a TA I also designed the course project (which is a short RL implementation projects that amounts for 20% of the course grade). I implemented [an RL environment that models epidemic dynamics](https://github.com/RenardDesNeiges/EpidemicsSimulator/tree/handout_with_solutions) in which students implemented a deep-Q-learning algorithm that handles epidemic mitigation.

### [PHYS-101(a/d) : Physique générale : mécanique](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/physique-generale-mecanique-PHYS-101-D) 
PHYS-101(a/d) is the first Physics course taken by undergrads at EPFL (the (a) course is given to Microengineering and Electrical Engineering students while the (d) course is givent to Mechanical Engineering students). It covers Newtonian mechanics, starting from coordinates systems until the introduction of the inertial tensors, some lecturers also include lagrangian mechanics in the course. This is the course I have helped teach the most (I was a TA 4 times for the course) and it has always been a pleasure to teach as it has the specificity of matching a small group of students to each TA and it gives a chance for TAs to really take of their group of students and see them improve as the year progresses. I assisted for Prof. [Philippe Müllhaupt](https://people.epfl.ch/philippe.muellhaupt?lang=fr), Prof. [Philippe Müllhaupt](https://people.epfl.ch/nicolas.grandjean) and Prof. [Daniele Mari](https://people.epfl.ch/109056?lang=en).

### [MICRO-315 : Embedded Systems and Robotics](https://isa.epfl.ch/imoniteur_ISAP/!itffichecours.htm?ww_i_matiere=2705910539&ww_x_anneeacad=2301874614&ww_i_section=945244&ww_i_niveau=2936295&ww_c_langue=en) 
MICRO-315 is an introduction to embedded systems programming and to robotics for Microengineering students, it is taught by Prof. [Francesco Mondada](https://people.epfl.ch/francesco.mondada). The course covers embedded C programming, real time operating systems and some practical signal processing to deal with robots sensors. I was a TA for the course for one semester during which I mostly helped students with their robotics projects.

### [MICRO-450 : Basis of Robotics for Manipulation](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/basics-of-robotics-for-manipulation-MICRO-450) 
MICRO-450 is an introduction to robotic manipulation, kinematic chains and control of robot arms, it is taught by Prof. [Mohamed Bouri](https://people.epfl.ch/mohamed.bouri).  I was a TA for the course for one semester during which I mostly helped students with exercise sessions.

### [MSE-237 : TP de Matériaux](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/tp-de-materiaux-MSE-237) 
MSE-237 is a set of practicals of material science taught to Microengineering students. I was a TA for the course for one semester during which I supervised a carbon emission assessment practical.
