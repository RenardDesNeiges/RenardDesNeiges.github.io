## About me

I am an aspiring machine learning/learning theory researcher, I hold a Master of Sciences in Robotics with a minor in Data Science as well as a Bachelor in Microengineering from École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). 

I am mostly interested in research topics at the intersection of optimization, decision theory, reinforcement learning and optimal control theory. 

My [Master thesis dissertation](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/304492?ln=en) - which I worked on at [SYCAMORE](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/sycamore/), under the sueprvision of Prof. [Maryam Kamgarpour](https://people.epfl.ch/maryam.kamgarpour) - was on obtaining **provable convergence guarantees for algorithms for constrained inverse reinforcement learning**. I am currently working publishing these results. Previously I have worked on **trajectory optimization for airborne wind energy** at [LA3](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/la3/) under the supervision of Prof. [Colin Jones](https://people.epfl.ch/colin.jones) and on **reinforcement learning with time-continuous neural networks for robotics** at [BIOROB](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/biorob/) under the supervision of Prof. [Auke Ijspeert](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/biorob/people/ijspeert/). My previous work is described in the past-projects section of this website.

Currently I am in search of a PhD position and I am working as a research intern at [SYCAMORE](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/sycamore/) on **sample complexity of inverse reinforcement learning** (on a paper that will be published in early 2024).
